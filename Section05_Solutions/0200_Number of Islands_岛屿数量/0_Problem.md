# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) (Medium)

Given an `m x n` 2d `grid` map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.



# [200. 岛屿数量](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

难度中等

给你一个由 `'1'`（陆地）和 `'0'`（水）组成的的二维网格，请你计算网格中岛屿的数量。

岛屿总是被水包围，并且每座岛屿只能由水平方向和/或竖直方向上相邻的陆地连接形成。

此外，你可以假设该网格的四条边均被水包围。

 

**示例 1：**

```
输入：grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
输出：1
```

**示例 2：**

```
输入：grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
输出：3
```

 

**提示：**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` 的值为 `'0'` 或 `'1'`



# 题目大意

求 `1` 的连通块的数量。两元素相邻指的是有公共边就相邻，只能上下左右，不能斜着来。
