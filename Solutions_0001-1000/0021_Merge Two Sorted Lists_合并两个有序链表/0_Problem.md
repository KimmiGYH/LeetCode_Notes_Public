# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new **sorted** list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.



# [21. 合并两个有序链表](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

难度简单

将两个升序链表合并为一个新的 **升序** 链表并返回。新链表是通过拼接给定的两个链表的所有节点组成的。 

 

**示例：**

```
输入：1->2->4, 1->3->4
输出：1->1->2->3->4->4
```
