# [221. Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/) (Medium)

Given an `m x n` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, *find the largest square containing only* `1`'s *and return its area*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max2grid.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.



# [221. 最大正方形](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximal-square/)

难度中等

在一个由 `'0'` 和 `'1'` 组成的二维矩阵内，找到只包含 `'1'` 的最大正方形，并返回其面积。

 

**示例 1：**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max1grid.jpg)

```
输入：matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
输出：4
```

**示例 2：**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max2grid.jpg)

```
输入：matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
输出：1
```

**示例 3：**

```
输入：matrix = [["0"]]
输出：0
```

 

**提示：**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `matrix[i][j]` 为 `'0'` 或 `'1'`
